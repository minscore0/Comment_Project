In this course, students continue their work from previous algebra and geometry courses by studying functions through graphical, numerical, and written representations. An emphasis is placed on exponential, logarithmic, rational, trigonometric, and inverse trigonometric functions. Additional topics to be investigated include sequences, series, and an introduction to limits. To enhance the understanding of these topics, data analysis and mathematical modeling of real world situations will be introduced. Technology is integrated throughout.
Amanda your academic performance in this class has been phenomenal. I know you can do better! Your level of attention is good, but I know you can go further! Your attendance is exceptional, you barely missed a minute of class this semester. Much of your homework was turned in late. The grade you earned on the previous exam was E, keep going! Amanda excelled at the unit circle, making a beautiful poster. I know you can push yourself further, that is why I must give you a B in this semester for this course. Regardless of how you do in class, I believe if you put a little more effort into this class it will be more beneficial for you. Keep going! I appreciate your effort coming to attend the class so early in the morning, but you should be getting your sleep at home and not at school. I know you can do it!
