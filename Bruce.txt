In Advanced Algebra, students build on work from previous algebra and geometry courses to study a variety of function types. This course focuses on both the theory and applications of functions. Piecewise linear functions are used to review and reinforce the definitions of function, graph, domain, and range. Students extensively study quadratic functions and explore the mathematics behind polynomials, including operations applied to polynomials and rational functions. Exponential properties are revisited and extended to study nth roots and exponentials. Function composition and the concept of inverse functions are also introduced and reinforced with an introduction to logarithms. Applications involving quadratic optimization, compound interest, and exponential growth and decay models are included.
Bruce your academic performance in this class has been satisfactory. A little more effort would make you exceed the academic goal. You can do it! You need to pay more attention in class, and stop being so easily distracted. Your attendance this semester was great, apart from a couple of days you were always there. You consistenly turned in your homework on time and you put effort into it and you asked for an extension whenever you couldn't complete an assignment. The grade you earned on the previous exam was D, keep going!  I know you can push yourself further, that is why I must give you a B in this semester for this course. Your engagement in this class has been very insightful. The thoughts and opinion you bring in this class shows perspectives that other have not encounter before. Your assignments also clearly show all your thinking, way to go!
