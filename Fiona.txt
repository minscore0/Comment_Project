In this course, students continue their work from previous algebra and geometry courses by studying functions through graphical, numerical, and written representations. An emphasis is placed on exponential, logarithmic, rational, trigonometric, and inverse trigonometric functions. Additional topics to be investigated include sequences, series, and an introduction to limits. To enhance the understanding of these topics, data analysis and mathematical modeling of real world situations will be introduced. Technology is integrated throughout.
