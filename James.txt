In this course, students continue their work from previous algebra and geometry courses by studying functions through graphical, numerical, and written representations. An emphasis is placed on exponential, logarithmic, rational, trigonometric, and inverse trigonometric functions. Additional topics to be investigated include sequences, series, and an introduction to limits. To enhance the understanding of these topics, data analysis and mathematical modeling of real world situations will be introduced. Technology is integrated throughout.
James I appreciate the amount of effort you put in this class. They are shown in your very well-rounded academic achievement. Goodjob! Your attention levels in class are satisfactory, but there is still room for improvement. Your attendance is alright, but you could show up to class in time more often. You consistenly turned in your homework on time and you put effort into it and you asked for an extension whenever you couldn't complete an assignment. The grade you earned on the previous exam was A, keep going!  That is why in this course you are being awarded an A-. Your humor brought to this class a very colorful and bright tone. You made this class feels more exciting. I appreciate that trait of you a lot. Your leadership in this class has shown through many activities we have done in class. Your ability to lead people and keep your peers in place is amazing to me. I'm sure this trait of you will make you a great adult in the future.
