In Advanced Algebra, students build on work from previous algebra and geometry courses to study a variety of function types. This course focuses on both the theory and applications of functions. Piecewise linear functions are used to review and reinforce the definitions of function, graph, domain, and range. Students extensively study quadratic functions and explore the mathematics behind polynomials, including operations applied to polynomials and rational functions. Exponential properties are revisited and extended to study nth roots and exponentials. Function composition and the concept of inverse functions are also introduced and reinforced with an introduction to logarithms. Applications involving quadratic optimization, compound interest, and exponential growth and decay models are included.
Marcus your academic performance has been almost consistently well, with a little more consistency you will exceed in this class! Your level of attention in class is great, but you can get to the next level, I believe in you! Your attendance is alright, but you could show up to class in time more often. You consistenly turned in your homework on time and you put effort into it and you asked for an extension whenever you couldn't complete an assignment. The grade you earned on the previous exam was D, keep going!  That is why in this course you are being awarded an A-. Regardless of how you do in class, I believe if you put a little more effort into this class it will be more beneficial for you. Keep going! Your humor brought to this class a very colorful and bright tone. You made this class feels more exciting. I appreciate that trait of you a lot.
