This is a college-level introductory calculus course designed to cover Differential Calculus (functions, limits, continuity, Intermediate Value Theorem, tangent lines, velocity, derivatives, rates of change, implicit differentiation, linear approximation, Mean Value Theorem, related rates, curve sketching, l’Hospital’s rule, and optimization problems); Integral Calculus (area, distance, Riemann sums, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, antiderivatives, integration techniques, and volume); and Differential Equations (slope fields, Euler’s Method, separation of variables, Newton’s Law of Cooling, and population growth).
Myra your academic performance has been almost consistently well, with a little more consistency you will exceed in this class! You need to pay more attention in class, and stop being so easily distracted. Your attendance is exceptional, you barely missed a minute of class this semester. Much of your homework was turned in late. The grade you earned on the previous exam was F, keep going!  I know you can push yourself further, that is why I must give you a B in this semester for this course. Your leadership in this class has shown through many activities we have done in class. Your ability to lead people and keep your peers in place is amazing to me. I'm sure this trait of you will make you a great adult in the future.
