In Advanced Algebra, students build on work from previous algebra and geometry courses to study a variety of function types. This course focuses on both the theory and applications of functions. Piecewise linear functions are used to review and reinforce the definitions of function, graph, domain, and range. Students extensively study quadratic functions and explore the mathematics behind polynomials, including operations applied to polynomials and rational functions. Exponential properties are revisited and extended to study nth roots and exponentials. Function composition and the concept of inverse functions are also introduced and reinforced with an introduction to logarithms. Applications involving quadratic optimization, compound interest, and exponential growth and decay models are included.
Nicole your academic performance has been almost consistently well, with a little more consistency you will exceed in this class! Your attention levels in class are satisfactory, but there is still room for improvement. You need to work in your attendence, during this semester in this course you barely showed up to class. Your homework is consistently comeplete and turned in on time. You put effort into making sure that your assignments are complete to your best ability. The grade you earned on the previous exam was C, keep going!  I know you can push yourself further, that is why I must give you a B in this semester for this course. Regardless of how you do in class, I believe if you put a little more effort into this class it will be more beneficial for you. Keep going! Your leadership in this class has shown through many activities we have done in class. Your ability to lead people and keep your peers in place is amazing to me. I'm sure this trait of you will make you a great adult in the future.
