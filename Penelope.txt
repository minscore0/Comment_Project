This is a college-level introductory calculus course designed to cover Differential Calculus (functions, limits, continuity, Intermediate Value Theorem, tangent lines, velocity, derivatives, rates of change, implicit differentiation, linear approximation, Mean Value Theorem, related rates, curve sketching, l’Hospital’s rule, and optimization problems); Integral Calculus (area, distance, Riemann sums, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, antiderivatives, integration techniques, and volume); and Differential Equations (slope fields, Euler’s Method, separation of variables, Newton’s Law of Cooling, and population growth).
Penelope your academic performance in this class has been phenomenal. I know you can do better! You need to pay more attention in class, and stop being so easily distracted. Your attendance is alright, but you could show up to class in time more often. You consistenly turned in your homework on time and you put effort into it and you asked for an extension whenever you couldn't complete an assignment. The grade you earned on the previous exam was F, keep going! Penelope often takes long bathroom breaks. Unfortunately, your work this semester did not fully meet basic expectations that is why you earned a C. Your humor brought to this class a very colorful and bright tone. You made this class feels more exciting. I appreciate that trait of you a lot. Your leadership in this class has shown through many activities we have done in class. Your ability to lead people and keep your peers in place is amazing to me. I'm sure this trait of you will make you a great adult in the future.
